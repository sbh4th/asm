  abstract = {In this article, we consider identification, estimation, and inference procedures for treatment effect parameters using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with (i) multiple time periods, (ii) variation in treatment timing, and (iii) when the “parallel trends assumption” holds potentially only after conditioning on observed covariates. We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Two-way fixed effects methods have been used to estimate effects of policies adopted in different places over time, but they can provide misleading results when effects are heterogeneous or dynamic, and alternate methods have been proposed.           Methods:~           We compared methods for estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under staggered adoption of policies, including two-way fixed effects, group-time ATT, cohort ATT, and target-trial approaches. We applied each method to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on preterm birth using the National Center for Health Statistics’ birth records. We compared each estimator’s performance in a simulation parameterized to mimic the empirical example. We generated constant, heterogeneous, and dynamic effects and calculated bias, mean squared error, and confidence interval coverage of each estimator across 1000 iterations.           Results:~           Two-way fixed effects estimated that Medicaid expansion increased the risk of preterm birth (risk difference [RD], 0.12; 95\% CI = 0.02, 0.22), while the group-time ATT, cohort ATT, and target-trial approaches estimated protective or null effects (group-time RD, −0.16; 95\% CI = −0.58, 0.26; cohort RD, −0.02; 95\% CI = −0.46, 0.41; target trial RD, −0.16; 95\% CI = −0.59, 0.26). In simulations, two-way fixed effects performed well when treatment effects were constant and less well under heterogeneous and dynamic effects.           Conclusions:~           We demonstrated why new approaches perform better than two-way fixed effects when treatment effects are heterogeneous or dynamic under a staggered policy adoption design, and created simulation and analysis code to promote understanding and wider use of these methods in the epidemiologic literature.},

  abstract = {In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.},

  abstract = {As part of the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government has developed air pollution prevention and control plans for key regions with a focus on the power, transport, and industrial sectors. Here, we investigate the contribution of residential emissions to regional air pollution in highly polluted eastern China during the heating season, and find that dramatic improvements in air quality would also result from reduction in residential emissions. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry to evaluate potential residential emission controls in Beijing and in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) region. In January and February 2010, relative to the base case, eliminating residential emissions in Beijing reduced daily average surface PM2.5 (particulate mater with aerodynamic diameter equal or smaller than 2.5 micrometer) concentrations by 14 ± 7 μg⋅m(-3) (22 ± 6\% of a baseline concentration of 67 ± 41 μg⋅m(-3); mean ± SD). Eliminating residential emissions in the BTH region reduced concentrations by 28 ± 19 μg⋅m(-3) (40 ± 9\% of 67 ± 41 μg⋅m(-3)), 44 ± 27 μg⋅m(-3) (43 ± 10\% of 99 ± 54 μg⋅m(-3)), and 25 ± 14 μg⋅m(-3) (35 ± 8\% of 70 ± 35 μg⋅m(-3)) in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces, respectively. Annually, elimination of residential sources in the BTH region reduced emissions of primary PM2.5 by 32\%, compared with 5\%, 6\%, and 58\% achieved by eliminating emissions from the transportation, power, and industry sectors, respectively. We also find air quality in Beijing would benefit substantially from reductions in residential emissions from regional controls in Tianjin and Hebei, indicating the value of policies at the regional level.},

  abstract = {Objectives:~         We aimed to estimate the effects of indoor and outdoor temperature on wintertime blood pressure (BP) among peri-urban Beijing adults.         Methods:~         We enrolled 1279 adults (ages: 40–89 years) and conducted measurements in two winter campaigns in 2018–2019 and 2019–2020. Study staff traveled to participant homes to administer a questionnaire and measure brachial and central BP. Indoor temperature was measured in the 5 min prior to BP measurement. Outdoor temperature was estimated from regional meteorological stations. We used multivariable mixed-effects regression models to estimate the within-individual and between-individual effects of indoor and outdoor temperatures on BP.         Results:~         Indoor and outdoor temperatures ranged from 0.0 to 28 °C and −14.3 to 6.4 °C, respectively. In adjusted models, a 1 °C increase in indoor temperature was associated with decreased SBP [−0.4 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI): −0.7 to −0.1 (between-individual; brachial and central BP); −0.5 mmHg, 95\% CI: −0.8 to −0.2 (within-individual, brachial BP); −0.4 mmHg, 95\% CI: −0.7 to −0.2 (within-individual, central BP)], DBP [−0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI:−0.4 to −0.03 (between-individual); −0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: −0.5 to −0.04 (within-individual)], and within-individual pulse pressure [−0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI: −0.4 to −0.04 (central); −0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: −0.4 to −0.1 (brachial)]. Between-individual SBP estimates were larger among participants with hypertension. There was no evidence of an effect of outdoor temperature on BP.         Conclusion:~         Our results support previous findings of inverse associations between indoor temperature and BP but contrast with prior evidence of an inverse relationship with outdoor temperature. Wintertime home heating may be a population-wide intervention strategy for high BP and cardiovascular disease in China.},

  date = {2015},

  location = {New York},
  abstract = {"The book provides an accessible but comprehensive overview of methods for mediation and interaction. There has been considerable and rapid methodological development on mediation and moderation/interaction analysis within the causal-inference literature over the last ten years. Much of this material appears in a variety of specialized journals, and some of the papers are quite technical. There has also been considerable interest in these developments from empirical researchers in the social and biomedical sciences. However, much of the material is not currently in a format that is accessible to them. The book closes these gaps by providing an accessible, comprehensive, book-length coverage of mediation. The book begins with a comprehensive introduction to mediation analysis, including chapters on concepts for mediation, regression-based methods, sensitivity analysis, time-to-event outcomes, methods for multiple mediators, methods for time-varying mediation and longitudinal data, and relations between mediation and other concepts involving intermediates such as surrogates, principal stratification, instrumental variables, and Mendelian randomization. The second part of the book concerns interaction or "moderation," including concepts for interaction, statistical interaction, confounding and interaction, mechanistic interaction, bias analysis for interaction, interaction in genetic studies, and power and sample-size calculation for interaction. The final part of the book provides comprehensive discussion about the relationships between mediation and interaction and unites these concepts within a single framework. This final part also provides an introduction to spillover effects or social interaction, concluding with a discussion of social-network analyses. The book is written to be accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics. Comprehensive appendices provide more technical details for the interested reader. Applied empirical examples from a variety of fields are given throughout. Software implementation in SAS, Stata, SPSS, and R is provided. The book should be accessible to students and researchers who have completed a first-year graduate sequence in quantitative methods in one of the social- or biomedical-sciences disciplines. The book will only presuppose familiarity with linear and logistic regression, and could potentially be used as an advanced undergraduate book as well"–},

  abstract = {I establish the equivalence between the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator and an estimator obtained from a pooled ordinary least squares regression that includes unit-specific time averages and time-period specific cross-sectional averages, which I call the two-way Mundlak (TWM) regression. This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},
