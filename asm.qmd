## Policy Context

Beijing designated “coal restricted areas”
Government subsidized electric or gas-powered heat pumps (80% of $4,500 cost) 
2017: required 1.5 million people to halt coal use (scaled to >2 million by ambitious local officials)
Stepped implementation from 2017-2021 in Beijing and northern China (63 million homes)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="20%"}

::: {.column width="75%"}

### Aim 1. `r emo::ji("point_left")`

Estimate the total effect of the intervention.

### Aim 2. `r emo::ji("cross_mark")` 

Estimate the contribution of changes in the chemical composition of $PM_{2.5}$ to the overall effect on health outcomes.

### Aim 3. `r emo::ji("point_left")`

Examine alternative [pathways and mechanisms]{.blue} that may contribute to the intervention’s impact.

# What Did We Do?

## First part of mediation: total effect

<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="25%"}

<br>

Step 1: Estimate the total effect of $T$.

## Second part of mediation: decomposition

Basic idea: understand pathways of effects 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="25%"}

<br>

Step 2: Estimate how much of the total effect is due to $PM_{2.5}$ vs. other pathways?

## Quantities of interest {background-image="images/basic-dag.png" background-size="30%" background-position="top 0% left 100%"}

Total effect:
$$\color{red}{E[Y|T,X]=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}T +\beta_{2}X}$$

This equation estimates the total effect of the ban:
$$\color{red}{TE=\beta_{1}(T^{*}-T)}$$
where $T^{*}$ is exposure to ban and $T$ is no exposure.


## Mediation model {background-image="images/basic-dag.png" background-size="30%" background-position="top 0% left 100%"}

Estimate two regressions:

1. Treatment on mediator:  

$${E[M|T,X]=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}T +\beta_{2}X}$$

. . . 

2. Treatment and mediator on outcome:  

$$\color{red}E[Y|T,X,M] = \theta_{0} + \theta_{1}T + \theta_{2}M + \theta_{3}TM + \theta_{4}X + \theta_{5}W$$


Second equation estimates the "Controlled Direct Effect":
$$\color{red}{CDE=\theta_{1}+\theta_{3}TM}$$

::: aside
See @vanderweele2015. Other quantities include the "Natural Direct Effect" ($\theta_{1} + \theta_{3}(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} + \beta_{2})$) and the "Natural Indirect Effect" ($\theta_{2}\beta_{1} + \theta_{3}\beta_{1}$)]

## Key assumptions {background-image="images/basic-dag.png" background-size="30%" background-position="top 0% left 100%"}

<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="20%"}

:::

::: {.column width="75%"}

Assumptions for valid CDE:

- No confounding of the total effect.
- No confounding of the mediator-outcome effect.

Valid NDE and NIE also require:

- No confounding of the exposure-mediator effect.
- No mediator–outcome confounder affected by treatment.

## What the hell is the CDE?
<br>

### Interpretation

*This effect is the contrast between the counterfactual outcome if the individual were exposed at $T=t$ and the counterfactual outcome if the same individual were exposed at* $T=t*$, *with the mediator set to a fixed level* $M=m$.

<br>

### English:

*"By how much would blood pressure change if the policy were implemented and we held $PM_{2.5}$ fixed at* $m$ *?"*

# What Did We Find?

## Treatment groups were generally balanced

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
bt <- readRDS(here("data-clean", 
  "t_balance.rds"))

btf <- tt(bt@table_dataframe) %>%
  group_tt(j = list(`Never enrolled (N=603)` = 2:3, 
    `Ever enrolled (N=400)` = 4:5)) %>%
  style_tt(j=1:7, fontsize = 0.7) %>%
  theme_tt("striped")
btf
```

## Treatment groups were generally balanced

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
bt <- readRDS(here("data-clean", 
  "t_balance.rds"))

knitr::kable(bt@table_dataframe) |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", 
    "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, font_size=30) %>%
  column_spec(1, width_min = '5in') %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Never treated (N=603)" = 2, 
                     "Ever treated (N=400)" = 2, " " = 2))
```

## Treated households adopted cleaner energy

## Treated households reported less coal use

## Policy reduced (only) indoor PM

## Policy reduced indoor temperature

## Policy reduced BP, respiratory symptoms, not biomarkers

## Most of the BP effect was mediated by PM and Temp

## Little mediation for respiratory symptoms
